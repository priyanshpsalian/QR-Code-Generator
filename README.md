<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot] -->

Generate free QR codes on this website. A QR code is a two dimensional barcode that stores information in black and white dots (called data pixels or “QR code modules”). Besides the black and white version, you can also create a colored QR code. For these codes to work without problems, make sure the contrast is sufficient and the result is not a negative (in terms of color). To make your QR code even better, you can also get a QR code with logo.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

<h2>Create a QR code</h2>

Just enter your text, your URL, a SMS or vCard contact information. The QR code will be generated automatically as you type. Just click on the “Download” button to get the created QR code image then (the image is available as EPS or SVG vector graphic, as well as high-resolution PNG, GIF or JPEG raster graphics format). You can also embed the QR code directly on your own website and use it, just have a look at the code offered by the “Embed” button. Of course, you can place and use the QR graphic on leaflets, posters, business cards or other products without any costs / for free (including commercial use).

QR codes are the way to go to create a link between the real world products (tagged with the QR code) and the Internet. Mobile, anywhere, anytime. Because QR codes make it so easy to transfer a web link to a mobile phone, they provide a significantly lower barrier to visit a site with a smart phone. But you can also work with other texts and data, such as advertising messages, telephone numbers and even entire business cards in vCard format. Just encode them with our QR code generator to easily transfer the data to mobile devices.

Use the `BLANK_README.md` to get started.
